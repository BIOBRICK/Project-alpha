# Input Data Description

## 1.Data Origin

The data involved in my project is so called "Public Bio-data", most of them are expression data come from [NCBI-GEO](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>). The GEO-id will be listed below.

Beside that, I also need some annotation files, I got them all from website [ENSEMBL](<http://www.ensembl.org/index.html>) by using FTP. To keep data in fashion, I use GRCh38/MM10 annotations.

All data have full available to everyone.

## 2. GEO Data Details

GEO data: GEO-id and Paper included.

## 3.Annotation Files

I.Gene Ensembl transcription file retrieved from Ensembl Biomart.

II.Cell-Meta-File created by myself.

III.Feature-Meta-File created by myself.

IV.Chip platform files were retrieved from GEO, exact match every expression matrix file.
