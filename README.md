# Project-alpha
This is my bioinformatics project used for my graduation, it's not complecated but necessary and yet to be my most important project so far.

However, I'm still learning hwo to use git thus this first and important project might be in a jumble.

I'll try, wait and see.

By the way, those scripts contained in this project, they will be well organized at least.
